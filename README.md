## Project

 `.Net Core WPF` desktop application in `C#`.

 This application was developed in an academic course during my second year of the bachelor in computed science at EPFC.  
 It uses a homemade framework provided by the teacher to simplify some steps (`PRBD_Framewok`).

## Description

 The project is an application that manages students, teachers, classes and evaluations.

 The student is registered to certain classes and may pass evaluations. He has access to a list of all classes he has taken, a list of evaluation dates as a calendar, grade point average and his information used to log in.

 The teacher saves and validates students'requests to attend class, creates a questions bank for each class he is in charge of as well as evaluations. He has access to all students grade points.
